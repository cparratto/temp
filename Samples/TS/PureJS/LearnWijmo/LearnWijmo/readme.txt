Learn Wijmo
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A catalog of fiddles that show the main features in all Wijmo modules.

This project shows how to use the wijmo.nav.TreeView control for navigation,
and how to style it using some cool CSS techniques.

It also uses a custom (very small) routing scheme that does not require
any frameworks.

This version includes fiddles for the following Wijmo modules

- wijmo (core)
- wijmo.input
- wijmo.grid

This is a work in progress (and probably will always be, as we plan to
keep refining the fiddles and adding more topics, controls, and 
features).

We will add chart, gauge, and nav soon. Other modules will follow.

If you have any requests or suggestions regarding this sample, please
