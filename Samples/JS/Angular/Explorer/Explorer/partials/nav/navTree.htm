        <h3>
            Navigation Trees</h3>
        <p>
            The simplest and most common use for the TreeView control is navigation.
            The TreeView's hierarchical structure and auto-search functionality make
            it easy for users to drill-down and find the items they are interested in.</p>
        <p>
            You can navigate the tree using the mouse or the keyboard. To navigate 
            with the mouse, click the node you want. To navigate with the keyboard,
            use the arrow keys to select the node you want and press Enter to commit
            the selection. Or type the node content to auto-search and press Enter to 
            commit the selection.</p>
